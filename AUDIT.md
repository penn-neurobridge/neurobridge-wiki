# Audit of the wiki, October 2026

Every page was read in full and scored against one question: could a new member of NeuroBridge, with no background in clinical neuroscience, follow it alone? The tables give one row per page. *Rel.* is who the page is for (core: our people do this; shared: CNT or Penn infrastructure we depend on; clinical coverage: participant-facing CNT work we only cover; reference: read once; retire). *Stale* and *New* run from 0 to 3: the risk that the page is out of date, and how far a newcomer gets unaided (3 is all the way). *Action* is the recommendation. The front matter of every procedure now carries a `scope` field and, where the audit recommends it, `audit: merge` or `audit: retire`; the site shows a banner for each, and the map has a Scope view.

Procedures: 148. Scope: core 56, shared infrastructure 23, clinical coverage 45, reference 9, retire 15. Stale risk 2 or 3: 123. Newcomer score 0 or 1: 84. Recommended actions: merge 45, rewrite 35, tighten 29, reframe-as-reference 17, retire 14, needs-pi 6, keep 2.

## What was fixed immediately

Secrets and identifiers that survived the import were removed on 5 October 2026 and the repository history was rewritten: a Pennsieve API token, the Natus VNC password (in two machine-written summaries), the pedro account password, the HUP6 door codes and scanner-laptop login, the neuropsych flash-drive password, a fund code, a session key in a URL, a patient's name in a withheld-screenshot note, a personal mobile number, coded subject identifiers in example paths, residue text from the previous knowledge base, one mention of it by name, and two links that pointed at the wrong page. `scripts/check_content.py` now fails the build on each of these patterns. Still to decide: the personal mobile numbers on *Important contacts*, staff PennKeys and names visible in screenshots, an AWS account number in the ieeg.org restart runbook, internal IP addresses, two Penn+Box folders shared as "anyone with the link", and non-defaced MRIs copied to SEAS servers (see the questions at the end).

## What a newcomer meets

The wiki is honest about what it contains but not about whom it is for. It was written over several years by and for the CNT's clinical research coordinators, and it still reads that way: 45 of the 149 procedures are participant-facing work (consenting, scanner day, bedside testing, reimbursement, scheduling trackers) that nobody in NeuroBridge performs, a further 23 describe CNT or Penn infrastructure the lab uses but does not run, and only 56 are things our own people do. Until this audit no page said which was which, so a new PhD student opening *Imaging* met eleven scanner-day pages before the four that concern them. The pages are also personal notes rather than procedures. They name people by first name (Josh, Gloria, Carolyn, Naseem, Mariam, Joel, Cat, Gabby, Marissa, Lisa, Steve) where a newcomer needs a role; they carry dates that have passed (an Azure token that expired in March 2026, a 7T protocol that ended in February, a server crash from May, a 2022 downtime banner, a 2023 VPN migration notice with empty steps); and almost none says why the step is done, what you need before you start, how you know it worked, or whom to ask. Of 149 procedures, 127 carry a stale-risk score of 2 or 3 and 125 would not get a newcomer to the end unaided.

A new data research coordinator can find the systems but not the rules. No Data page states which systems may hold identified data, and the pages contradict the lab's own rule: *Data storage locations* calls Borel "main storage for limited and anonymized EEG data", the rsync pages copy from cnt1 to Borel with no de-identification gate, the computing schematic and *PMACS overview* say the BSC cluster allows no PHI while the glossary says it does, and the reconstruction pages copy non-defaced T1 images to Leif and to a Box folder shared with anyone who has the link. The one route to every account, *Submitting CETS and PMACS helpdesk tickets*, lists CNT sponsors, a Neurology department code and a CNT IRB form, so the coordinator cannot tell who files for them or which group they join. The pipeline they must learn first, *Processing for ieeg.org*, is a 2,245-word command transcript in which the same five steps are pasted four times with small unexplained differences, struck-through commands, a "need to update with new scripts" flag and a contradiction about whether a file is deleted. Three different EDF de-identification scripts appear across two themes with no statement of which is current or what each removes.

A new PhD student from computer science meets the vocabulary before the explanation. EMU, Natus, iEEG, mef, RID and HUP numbers appear from the first paragraph of most pages and are defined only in the glossary, which nothing pointed to. There is no page that explains what the lab's data is and how it came to exist, no page on downloading a de-identified dataset from ieeg.org as a consumer rather than an uploader, and *Pennsieve downloader* never says where the script lives. The compute path exists (Borel over SSH, Leif, SLURM) but the SLURM page opens with a CETS email saying the scheduler "could use more than basic testing", and there was no page of things you must never do. The student would most likely ask a labmate within ten minutes and never return.

A master's student working on MRI-derived features finds the four workflows that matter to them, RADAR pulls, scan landing, DICOM to NIfTI and electrode reconstruction, scattered among scanner-day checklists, consent scripts and billing reviews. Reconstruction runs to about 7,200 words across five pages that repeat each other, with two routes and no rule for choosing. The NIfTI de-identification page assumes a BIDS conversion procedure that does not exist, and there is no defacing policy, no coding conventions page and no statement of where derived data should be written.

A postdoc arriving from physics to work on stroke or brain injury finds that only the Data and Compute themes apply to them unchanged; *What this lab is* says the stroke and TBI procedures are "to be added", which is true and should stay visible. The IRB and personnel pages they will be asked about are the CNT's, by first name, with one link that pointed at a page about mounting a file server. *Contributing*, the style guide and the SOP template are good and are the right place to send them when they build their first pipeline.

What the site needed, and now has, is routing: a *Start here* page that tells each of these four people what to read and in what order, a banner on every page that says whether it is ours, shared, reference or clinical coverage, a scope view on the map, and the five rules a newcomer must not break stated once, prominently. What it still needs is in the tables below: about fifty merges that would take the six themes from 149 procedures to roughly a hundred, fifteen retirements, a one-page data-governance statement that resolves the contradictions above, and a dozen pages that do not exist yet: a REDCap project catalogue, identifier mapping (MRN, RID, HUP, subject IDs), getting data out of REDCap, Data Structure v1.0 and the BIDS layout, how collaborating sites deliver data, a defacing policy, a BIDS conversion procedure, a NeuroBridge onboarding matrix by role, requesting cnt1 and cnt-fs access, required trainings, and a consumer's guide to ieeg.org and Pennsieve.


## Data

## Five biggest newcomer problems

1. **A live credential and personal identifiers remain.** "Uploading from cnt1 to Pennsieve" prints a Pennsieve `api_token`/`api_secret` (`a62ced44-…`); its abstract even announces it, and no "Credential removed" box was applied. Former members' logins (`asuncion`, `mjosyula`, `jchin09`, `bach2`, `asuncioj`) and real coded subject IDs (`RID1092`, `RID1038`, `HUP298`) sit in example paths and screenshots.
2. **The PHI boundary is never stated.** No Data page says which systems may hold identified data. The rsync pages show cnt1 → Borel copies with no gate, and "Data Storage Locations" calls Borel "main storage for limited … EEG data", contradicting the rule that SEAS servers never hold PHI.
3. **Pages are command histories, not procedures.** Almost none says why, who, when, what you need first, or how you know it worked. The 3T/7T page promises child pages that moved to Imaging; the rclone page depends on a retired setup SOP; "Pennsieve Downloader" never says where the script lives; the NIfTI page still says "(Mariam needs to update path)"; one rsync page states the trailing-slash rule backwards.
4. **Three divergent EDF de-identification scripts, no standard.** `edf_deid_wrapper.sh` (strips all annotations), `edf_headers/anonymize_edf.sh`, and the newer `edf_anonymize/anonymize_edfs.sh` with date shifting appear across Data and Electrophysiology with no statement of which is current or what each removes. "Limited vs anonymized", RID → HUP renumbering and the 1/1/2000 date shift are defined only under Compute.
5. **Expired or unowned prerequisites.** The Azure SAS token "expires on 03/15/2026" (past). The storage account is Brian Litt's `cntlitt`; BSC examples use `davis_group`; Pennsieve workspace ownership is unspecified; every page has empty `owner` and `last_reviewed` fields.

## Merge or go

Merge the two rsync pages; merge the two Pennsieve upload pages (laptop vs `module load pennsieve` on cnt1); merge "De-Identifying EDFs" and "EDF Headers" into one page and leave Mxene export/upload to Electrophysiology; fold "Azure Portal & Storage Tiers" into the scripts page; fold the 3T/7T stub into the storage table. Retire the AWS bucket roster to a CETS-owned spreadsheet, keeping a three-line note on where ieeg.org uploads land. No page names a legacy KB tool, though one carries a "You do not have access to this Doc" embed fragment.

## Missing pages a newcomer would expect

A one-page data-governance rule (what may live where, what must happen before data crosses); Data Structure v1.0 and the BIDS layout; how collaborating sites deliver data and where it lands; key custody (RID ↔ HUP ↔ identity, who holds it); a "may this leave PMACS?" checklist; and an archive inventory.

## First-read order

Data index (with a framing paragraph) → Data Storage Locations (as a table) → De-identification overview → Moving data (rsync, then rclone) → Pennsieve access rules → Pennsieve upload and download → Archiving and unarchiving.

## Compute

**Five biggest problems for a newcomer.**

1. The theme never answers its own question. `compute/index.md` asks "What do I run things on, and how do I get in?", but no page states the first rule: identified data only on cnt1/cnt-fs/BSC behind the PMACS VPN; de-identified work on Borel/Leif/Finkel behind GlobalProtect; code on GitHub, never data. The page meant to carry this, the CNT Computing Schematic, is a "WORK IN PROGRESS" table with an unlabeled column, retired-page stubs and a BSC row marked "No PHI allowed", contradicting the lab-manual glossary (BSC PHI permitted, 2026-09-20). PMACS Overview repeats the contradiction.

2. About half the body text is pasted email, Slack and ticket residue frozen mid-transition: the SLURM page opens with CETS saying the scheduler "could use more than basic testing"; the BSC page carries a 2022 downtime banner and a 2025 ticket thread; the VPN page is the 2023 Pulse-to-Ivanti notice with empty connect steps. Named CNT people (Josh, John Frommeyer, Curt) stand in for roles.

3. The access path is CNT's, not NeuroBridge's. The tickets page, the only route to every account, lists sponsors "Kathryn Davis / Brian Litt / Flavia Vitale, Dept: Neurology", a CNT IRB form, Littlab usergroups and "Contact Josh Asuncion" three times. A newcomer cannot tell who files for them or which group they join.

4. No page gives prerequisites in order or a verification step. The chain IRB, PMACS account, VPN, VDI, cnt1 is scattered across four pages; nothing says how you know a login or job worked.

5. Dead links and duplication: Software Tools Index is five retired pages; VDI/cnt-fs/cnt1 has three dead links of four; the Borel SSH page cites a "Migration to Leif" page absent from the wiki; the PMACS link block is pasted on three pages.

**Merge or go.** Retire Linux Command Shortcuts (move its group-ownership tip to the BSC page; it also dumps 29 PennKeys and a sub-RID path) and Software Tools Index. Merge SLURM limits into the SLURM how-to, the LPC welcome email and cntgpu1 into a rewritten PMACS Overview, and Hayden Hall into the Operations remote-access page. Reframe the 4,166-word AWS @ Penn guide as a link plus ten lab-specific lines. Fold the electrophysiology "Restarting ieeg.org" stub into the AWS restart runbook, the only page a newcomer could follow alone.

**Missing pages:** "Which system for which data" (schematic merged with Data > Storage Locations); "Day-one accounts and who files them"; "Set up your environment on Borel"; "The three VPNs"; an LSF quick start for BSC.

**First-read order:** rewritten schematic; access matrix from the tickets page; PMACS VPN, Borel SSH, Leif mount; SLURM how-to with limits; BSC; AWS only if you maintain ieeg.org.

## Imaging

28 pages (7 indexes, 21 procedures). Relevance: 9 core, 4 shared-infra, 11 cnt-clinical, 4 reference-only. Actions: 11 merge, 5 tighten, 5 reframe-as-reference, 4 rewrite, 2 retire, 1 needs-pi.

## Five biggest problems for a newcomer

1. **Live credentials.** "Pedro → cnt-fs (7T)" prints the pedro password twice and its abstract says "password given"; "Running the fMRI" prints three door codes and the laptop login, echoed in its abstract. Neither carries the "Credential removed" box. Fix first.
2. **The theme is written for a CNT scanner-day CRC.** Eleven of 21 procedures (scheduling, PennChart orders, consenting at the 3T/7T, the fMRI training script, billing review) are performed by nobody in NeuroBridge. Nothing tells an analyst that, or which four workflows are theirs: RADAR pulls, scan landing, DICOM→NIfTI, electrode reconstruction.
3. **Three contradictory 7T transfer stories:** hard drive (pointing at a retired page), CD burned by a tech, and Pedro. A newcomer cannot tell which is current, so the control-exclusion rule that depends on it is unexecutable.
4. **Reconstruction is spread over five overlapping pages** (~7,200 words, roughly 70% repeated) with two routes and no decision rule, named-person workarounds, a 2022 note, dead Google-hosted images, a punycode-broken link and a stray `scp` with a real pennkey and subject. No QC checklist anywhere.
5. **No verification steps and no owners.** Only "Opening ITK-SNAP files" says how to know it worked. Every page has empty `owner`/`last_reviewed`, names people by first name, and assumes PMACS, UPHS, Sectra, CAMRIS or Flywheel access.

## Merge or retire

Retire *Running the 7T* and *7T Badge Access* (fully duplicated). Merge the three 7T pages into one; the radiology email template into the 3T scheduling page; the three post-scan transfer pages into one "research scan → cnt-fs" page; and the five reconstruction pages into one canonical GUI/Docker procedure with appendices (Borel fallback, c3d check, MUSC variant, grids, reader-side ITK-SNAP). The theme shrinks from 21 procedures to about nine.

## Missing pages

A one-page "Imaging data in this lab" overview (modalities, protocols 819126/818407, where raw and BIDS imaging live, what is de-identified where); a BIDS/heudiconv conversion SOP, which the NIfTI de-identification page already assumes; a defacing policy, because non-defaced T1s currently travel to Borel/Leif and to a public-link Box folder; and a short "requesting access" page (PMACS, VPN client, Flywheel, Sectra, CAMRIS).

## First-read order

Rewritten Imaging index, then RADAR Data Pulls, the merged scan-landing page, DICOM → NIfTI, the canonical reconstruction page, Opening ITK-SNAP files. Scheduling and at-the-scanner pages come last, labelled "CNT clinical (reference)", for whoever covers a scan visit.

## Needs the PI

Current 7T transfer path; whether NeuroBridge runs reconstructions or consumes them; defacing on SEAS servers; which IRB covers RADAR pulls; the canonical cnt-fs mount and VPN client.

## Electrophysiology

## Five biggest newcomer problems

1. **A live password survived in two abstract boxes.** "Exporting Files from Natus" and its "(Pioneer)" copy carry the "Credential removed" warning, yet their machine-generated abstracts still print the Natus VNC password ("password xltek") — the credential that, misused, wipes every hospital's Natus data. It also gives a personal mobile number; three screenshots show real pennkeys.
2. **The core procedure is a 2,245-word command transcript pasted four times.** "Processing for ieeg.org" repeats five steps for four recording types with small unexplained differences, keeps struck-through commands and a "need to update with new scripts" flag, and contradicts itself about deleting `annotations.iann.json`. Nothing explains redaction or how to verify the upload.
3. **No framing anywhere.** The index asks how a recording gets acquired and never answers; the overview still speaks as "the staff of the CNT". No page states the PHI boundary (Natus and cnt-fs identified; ieeg.org date-shifted to 2000-01-01), who in NeuroBridge runs any of this, or how sEEG lands in Data Structure v1.0.
4. **Dead ends and dated breakage.** Archiving says "05/19/2026 — cnt1 crashed" and offers two routes with no verdict; Unarchiving and Restarting ieeg.org are stubs pointing at a retired knowledge-base page; "Lisa", "Josh A.", "Sarah Cormiea" appear by first name; the bedside task runs PsychoPy 1.83 via Box links.
5. **Duplication with drift.** Three channel-mapping pages, two scalp pipelines that disagree on `edit_studylist.py`'s arguments, Mxene content in three places, mount steps pasted into three pages. Names differ by case and version: `natusdir`/`natusDir`, `ieeg-latest`/`ieeg-cli-1.14.60`, `natus-latest`/`natus-converter-1.2.14`.

No page names a legacy KB tool.

## Merge or go

Retire the "(Pioneer)" export page, the legacy manual channel map, the duplicate scalp page and Restarting ieeg.org. Merge the second automated channel-mapping page into the first, the `.ini` page into a generalised "Anonymize & Upload EDFs", Mxene down to a one-screen specifics page, "Adding a file" into Troubleshooting, and "Final step" and "The config Folder" into Processing. Move "Mounting cnt-fs" to Compute and "Epilog ESI" to Imaging; rename the archiving section, which archives cnt-fs to Azure, not ieeg.org.

## Missing pages a newcomer would expect

A pipeline overview with roles and a diagram; a glossary (Natus, EMU, mef, CCEPS, HUP/RID); a consumer page on downloading HUP datasets from ieeg.org; text templates for natusdir and data-collection files; an unarchiving procedure; a per-patient status tracker; and how sEEG maps into Data Structure v1.0.

## First-read order

Index (framed) → sEEG overview (rewritten) → Mounting cnt-fs and ieeg.properties → Setup for Processing → natusdir & data collection → Automated Channel Mapping → Processing (one parameterised page) → Splitting and Troubleshooting → config folder → Archiving. Scalp EEG and special protocols afterwards; EMU Acquisition only for clinical cover.

## REDCap & Clinical Metadata

Eleven pages (three indexes, eight content pages, 2,876 body words). The lab manual calls this "the clinical-variable layer that joins to every dataset"; as imported it is a CNT coordinator's data-entry notebook.

**Five biggest problems for a newcomer.** First, no catalogue of projects: four REDCap projects appear across the theme and wiki (the "surgical outcomes project", elsewhere the CNT or REDCap Surgical Repository; the Multimodal Clinical 3T Repository, pid 42518; Quantitative MRI for Epilepsy Surgical Planning; an unnamed "old" and "new" REDCap) with no PIDs, owners or statement of which NeuroBridge owns, while both indexes claim "projects the lab maintains". Second, the theme is entry-only: nothing explains how data leaves REDCap (exports, API tokens, de-identification, allowed locations) or how RID, MRN, HUP and subject IDs link a record to the BIDS datasets. Third, every procedure is a personal note: first names (Joel, Kate, Cat, Gabby, Mariam), "flag these for me", "I usually import in groups of 10", an "add screenshot once finalized" placeholder, a Q&A transcript and a bare DOI link. Fourth, three pages contradict themselves: the scale-invite text names instrument `prep_epileptologists` while its screenshot shows `prep_pre`; REDCap Tips says "unchecking" identifier-field removal in the abstract and "check off" in the body, for an action that grants PHI export rights; the Engel→ILAE text and table image word 4B differently. Fifth, policy residue: a patient name sits in the HTML title attribute of the withheld-screenshot placeholder on Seizure Terminology Reference; the RADAR page says clinical scans land on "borel, BSC" although Borel is not a PHI location; the working CSV with MRN and DOB has no storage rule.

**Merge or go.** Fold IC-CoDE into the RADAR page's neuropsych subsection; nest Messaging in PennChart under the Surgical Outcomes page (or move it to Operations) and drop its duplicate screenshot; turn Old → New Field Mapping into a changelog table with an analysis-caveat column; keep Triggering REDCap Scale Invites only as a CNT-coordinator reference once the instrument names are corrected, or drop it if nobody in NeuroBridge triggers invites.

**Missing pages.** A REDCap projects catalogue; "Getting data out of REDCap"; an identifier-mapping page (MRN ↔ RID ↔ HUP ↔ 3T/7T subject IDs); data-dictionary links for the Surgical Repository and the 3T repository; DAG and export-rights governance for the collaborating sites; a link to Requesting a REDCap Account, which already exists under Operations.

**First-read order.** Theme index rewritten around the project catalogue; Surgical Outcomes REDCap Project as the project overview; Seizure Terminology Reference as the coding conventions behind the outcome variables; RADAR Pull → REDCap Entry with its Imaging sibling; REDCap Tips as DAG and export administration. The two CNT-clinical pages and the migration changelog are consulted only when needed.

## Operations

59 pages read in full. Relevance: 32 cnt-clinical, 12 shared-infra, 9 core, 2 reference-only, 4 retire. Action: 22 merge, 19 tighten, 6 rewrite, 6 retire, 4 reframe-as-reference, 2 keep.

**Five biggest problems for a newcomer.** First, the theme is written for a CNT clinical CRC: 32 of 59 pages cover consenting, scan trackers, ClinCard payments, CAMRIS and neuropsych testing, which nobody in NeuroBridge performs, while the two pages everyone needs, the onboarding and access checklists, assign every step to a first name (Josh, Gloria, Carolyn) and omit NeuroBridge's own systems (Slack, GitHub, Pennsieve, cnt1, Data Structure v1.0). Second, residue: the abstract of neuropsych-battery-materials.md still prints the flash-drive password (819126818407) above its "Credential removed" box; the contacts page carries personal mobile numbers for eight physicians; adding-a-non-penn-new-hire names the retired task tool, and its "personnel list" link (also on adding-personnel-to-an-irb-study) points to Mounting cnt-fs. Third, fragmentation: seven Greenphire pages are one BEN Helps form with different radio buttons, three CAMRIS pages share six identical steps, VPN/Citrix/Hayden Hall repeat one ticket flow, the 3T and 7T scripts differ by four parameters, and four PHI stubs say "ask the CRC lead" without naming system or lead. Fourth, no page states why, when, prerequisites or verification; nothing says IRB membership precedes cnt-fs or REDCap access, and front matter tags every access page for all five roles. Fifth, facts disagree: 7T compensation is $50 in the script and $90/$100 in Greenphire, MXene is 856681 on one page and 858681 on another, scripts promise a W-9/C-2 voucher while Greenphire pays by virtual card, and dated items (06/25/2026 roster, 7T end date 2/28/26) are already past.

**Merge or go.** Retire rppr-dates-targets, the three archive stubs, closing-an-irb-study and the scheduling-trackers index. Merge Greenphire seven into two, CAMRIS three into one, VPN + Citrix + Hayden Hall into one UPHS-ticket page, shared-drive + EMU mapping, 3T + 7T scripts, remote e-consent into e-consent, signed-ICF emails into contacting patients, Pavilion + PennChart into "Required trainings", the CRC access checklist into a rewritten onboarding matrix, and the contacts index into the Operations index.

**Missing pages a newcomer expects.** A role-based NeuroBridge onboarding matrix with an offboarding data handover; a protocol map (which IRB number grants which data); a required-trainings page (CITI, GCP, HIPAA, renewals); requesting cnt1/cnt-fs/BSC access (the Lab Manual flags it "not yet in the wiki"); a NeuroBridge directory and credentials policy.

**First-read order.** Operations index, the rewritten Onboarding & Offboarding Checklist, Adding Personnel to an IRB Study, Requesting a REDCap Account, UPHS VPN/Citrix (only if you need PennChart or the EMU drive), ieeg.org and Penn+Box access, the e-Regulatory Binder page (what documents you owe), then the emergency numbers. Clinical pages only when covering clinical duties.
