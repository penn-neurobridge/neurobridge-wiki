![REDCap Data Import Tool CSV upload options](../../assets/operations/edoa-redcap-entry/edoa-redcap-entry-03.png)

[📄 Example\_eDoA\_Import\_Template.csv](../../assets/operations/edoa-redcap-entry/04-example-edoa-import-template.csv)

For other studies, the import will work the same--just ensure that the column titles on your csv match REDCap. If you export a project from REDCap, it will show you the appropriate titles that you should use for the csv you want to import.
