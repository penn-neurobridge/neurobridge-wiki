# Data Storage Locations

!!! abstract "What this page tells you"
    One-line descriptions of where CNT data lives: Borel/Pioneer (CETS; anonymized EEG, code, analysis output), IEEG.org (public portal on AWS), BSC (PMACS imaging cluster), cnt1/cnt-fs (PHI way station for de-identification), and REDCap (clinical research database).

•**Borel, Pioneer (CETS)**
•**Borel:** Linux server with compute & storage; sandbox space for EEG & imaging (to be moved to BSC)
**•Pioneer:** GPU server connected to Borel; compute server with good processing speed
•Main storage for limited and anonymized EEG data, code, output of analyses
**•**[**IEEG.org**](http://IEEG.org) **(CNT)**
•Online public portal, where AWS backend stores processed, anonymized EEG
•Web based EEG viewer
**•BSC (PMACS)**
•Computing cluster in LPC environment for imaging data, analyses
•**cnt1, cnt-fs (PMACS)**
•Linux server and Windows file share
•temporary way station to collect PHI data for de-identification
•**REDCap (PMACS)**
•Database for clinical research data; can create queries to generate reports
•Manually extracted from EHR metadata and study specific data
