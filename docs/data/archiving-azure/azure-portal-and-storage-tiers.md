*   **Hot tier** - An online tier optimized for storing data that is accessed or modified frequently. The hot tier has the highest storage costs, but the lowest access costs.
*   **Cool tier** - An online tier optimized for storing data that is infrequently accessed or modified. Data in the cool tier should be stored for a minimum of **30** days. The cool tier has lower storage costs and higher access costs compared to the hot tier.
*   **Cold tier** - An online tier optimized for storing data that is rarely accessed or modified, but still requires fast retrieval. Data in the cold tier should be stored for a minimum of **90** days. The cold tier has lower storage costs and higher access costs compared to the cool tier.
*   **Archive tier** - An offline tier optimized for storing data that is rarely accessed, and that has flexible latency requirements, on the order of hours. Data in the archive tier should be stored for a minimum of **180** days.
